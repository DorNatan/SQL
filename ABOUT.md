# About

This repository hosts a collection of sample MySQL databases and accompanying SQL scripts used for learning and practicing data analysis.
Each `<dataset>_mysql.sql` file defines a self-contained schema and populates it with example data.
Additional `*_data_analysis.sql` files demonstrate typical querying patterns for filtering, aggregating, joining and other operations.

Use these scripts to experiment locally and explore real-world SQL scenarios. The README provides details on loading the databases and running the small test suite.
